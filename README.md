RemSys
======

In the root folder you can find the installable files 
<br/>
-> RemSysv2.apk (Android installable file)
<br/>
-> Servidor.jar (Java executable file belonging to the Server)

Their sources are in RemSys and Server folder respectively.

The documentation and presentation of the project are in "Documentation" folder with the name Project_Report.pdf and Project_Presentation.pdf respectively.

These documents are in spanish. The Project_Report.pdf file contains the user guide and the source I developed.

Thanks and enjoy!
